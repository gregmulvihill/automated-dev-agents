# Automated Development System with Configurable Agents

![Status: Pre-Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Pre--Alpha-red)

> **⚠️ PRE-ALPHA WARNING ⚠️**  
> This project is in pre-alpha stage. The content has been created conceptually but has not been tested. Proceed with caution as significant changes may occur before the first stable release.

## Overview

Automated Development System with Configurable Agents (ADCA) is a framework for creating specialized AI agents that automate various aspects of the software development lifecycle. It leverages a multi-tiered approach to break down complex development tasks into discrete missions that can be handled by specialized agents working in coordination.

Built as a companion to the [Multi-Tiered Memory Architecture (MTMA)](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/multi-tiered-memory-architecture) project, this system aims to accelerate development through intelligent automation while maintaining high quality standards.

## Architecture

The system employs a three-tiered agent architecture:

1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Central coordinator that manages tasks, allocates resources, and tracks progress
2. **Specialized Agents** - Domain-specific workers focused on particular aspects of development
3. **Utility Agents** - Support services providing common functionality across the system

Each agent utilizes the MTMA system for internal memory and inter-agent communication, creating a unified development ecosystem.

## Features (Planned)

- **Configurable Agent Framework** - Create specialized agents with defined capabilities and resources
- **Task Management System** - Break down complex objectives into discrete, manageable tasks
- **Inter-Agent Communication** - Standardized protocols for effective agent collaboration
- **Integration with Development Tools** - Connect to version control, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems
- **Learning Mechanisms** - Improve agent performance through feedback and experience
- **Human Oversight Controls** - Well-defined intervention points for supervision and decision-making
- **Progress Reporting** - Detailed updates on task completion and project status
