> **⚠️ PRE-ALPHA WARNING ⚠️**  
> This project is in pre-alpha stage. The content has been created conceptually but has not been tested. Proceed with caution as significant changes may occur before the first stable release.

## Overview

Automated Development System with Configurable Agents (ADCA) is a framework for creating specialized AI agents that automate various aspects of the software development lifecycle. It leverages a multi-tiered approach to break down complex development tasks into discrete missions that can be handled by specialized agents working in coordination.

ADCA is part of a larger ecosystem of repositories that work together to form a complete AI-driven development platform:

- **[Orchestrate-AI](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/orchestrate-ai)**: The high-level strategic orchestration system that manages workflows, business logic, and prioritization
- **[ADCA](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/automated-dev-agents)** (this repository): The tactical task execution and agent management layer
- **[Multi-Tiered Memory Architecture (MTMA)](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/multi-tiered-memory-architecture)**: The foundation layer providing memory persistence, context preservation, and knowledge management

## System Architecture

The three-tier architecture of our ecosystem positions ADCA as the middle layer:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ORCHESTRATE-AI                                  │
│ (Strategic Orchestration & Business Logic)      │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ AUTOMATED-DEV-AGENTS (ADCA)                     │
│ (Tactical Task Execution & Agent Management)    │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ MULTI-TIERED MEMORY ARCHITECTURE (MTMA)         │
│ (Persistence, Context Preservation, Knowledge)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

ADCA receives strategic goals and task priorities from Orchestrate-AI, then executes these tasks using specialized agents. It relies on MTMA for memory operations, enabling persistent context across agent operations.

## Agent Architecture

The system employs a three-tiered agent architecture:

1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Central coordinator that manages tasks, allocates resources, and tracks progress
2. **Specialized Agents** - Domain-specific workers focused on particular aspects of development
3. **Utility Agents** - Support services providing common functionality across the system

Each agent utilizes the MTMA system for internal memory and inter-agent communication, creating a unified development ecosystem.

## Features (Planned)

- **Configurable Agent Framework** - Create specialized agents with defined capabilities and resources
- **Task Management System** - Break down complex objectives into discrete, manageable tasks
- **Inter-Agent Communication** - Standardized protocols for effective agent collaboration
- **Integration with Development Tools** - Connect to version control, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems
- **Learning Mechanisms** - Improve agent performance through feedback and experience
- **Human Oversight Controls** - Well-defined intervention points for supervision and decision-making
- **Progress Reporting** - Detailed updates on task completion and project status

## Getting Started

> 🚧 **Coming Soon** 🚧

Detailed setup and usage instructions will be provided as the project matures.

### Prerequisites (Planned)

- Python 3.10+
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Neo4j
- Qdrant
- FastAPI

### Integration with Other Systems

For a complete development platform, you'll want to set up:

1. **[Orchestrate-AI](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/orchestrate-ai)** - For strategic orchestration
2. **[MTMA](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/multi-tiered-memory-architecture)** - For memory operations

See the [integration guide](docs/integration.md) for details on connecting these systems.
