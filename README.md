# Automated Development System with Configurable Agents

![Status: Pre-Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Pre--Alpha-red)

> **⚠️ PRE-ALPHA WARNING ⚠️**  
> This project is in pre-alpha stage. The content has been created conceptually but has not been tested. Proceed with caution as significant changes may occur before the first stable release.

## Overview

Automated Development System with Configurable Agents (ADCA) is a framework for creating specialized AI agents that automate various aspects of the software development lifecycle. It leverages a multi-tiered approach to break down complex development tasks into discrete missions that can be handled by specialized agents working in coordination.

ADCA is part of a larger ecosystem:
- It receives strategic direction and task prioritization from [Orchestrate-AI](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/orchestrate-ai)
- It leverages [Multi-Tiered Memory Architecture (MTMA)](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/multi-tiered-memory-architecture) for memory persistence and knowledge sharing

## Ecosystem Architecture

ADCA functions as the tactical/execution layer in a three-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ORCHESTRATE-AI                                  │
│ (Strategic Orchestration & Business Logic)      │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ AUTOMATED-DEV-AGENTS (This Repository)          │
│ (Tactical Task Execution & Agent Management)    │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ MULTI-TIERED MEMORY ARCHITECTURE                │
│ (Persistence, Context Preservation, Knowledge)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Agent Architecture

The system employs a three-tiered agent architecture:

1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Central coordinator that manages tasks, allocates resources, and tracks progress
2. **Specialized Agents** - Domain-specific workers focused on particular aspects of development
3. **Utility Agents** - Support services providing common functionality across the system

Each agent utilizes the MTMA system for internal memory and inter-agent communication, creating a unified development ecosystem.

## Features (Planned)

- **Configurable Agent Framework** - Create specialized agents with defined capabilities and resources
- **Task Management System** - Break down complex objectives into discrete, manageable tasks
- **Inter-Agent Communication** - Standardized protocols for effective agent collaboration
- **Integration with Development Tools** - Connect to version control, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems
- **Learning Mechanisms** - Improve agent performance through feedback and experience
- **Human Oversight Controls** - Well-defined intervention points for supervision and decision-making
- **Progress Reporting** - Detailed updates on task completion and project status

## Integration Points

### Integration with Orchestrate-AI
- Receives high-level tasks and priorities from Orchestrate-AI
- Provides task execution status and results back to Orchestrate-AI
- Follows strategic direction set by Orchestrate-AI workflows

### Integration with MTMA
- Uses MTMA for all memory operations (short-term, long-term, world state)
- Stores task contexts and results in the appropriate memory tiers
- Leverages MTMA's search capabilities to retrieve relevant context
- Maintains agent state through MTMA's persistence layer
